This package provides access to [dxFeed market data](https://dxfeed.com/market-data/).
The library is built as a language-specific wrapper over
the [dxFeed Graal Native](https://dxfeed.jfrog.io/artifactory/maven-open/com/dxfeed/graal-native-api/) library,
which was compiled with [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/)
and [dxFeed Java API](https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/overview-summary.html) (our flagman API).

## Overview

dxFeed Graal Swift API allows developers to create efficient applications in Swift language. This enables developers to leverage all the benefits of native app development, resulting in maximum performance and usability for end users.


### Milestones

As part of our ongoing development efforts, we are pleased to announce that a new repository is currently under construction and is expected to be completed by Q1â€™2024. We are working diligently to ensure that this new repository meets all of our standards for performance, security, and scalability. We will be providing regular updates throughout the development process.

If you have any questions, please contact us via
our [customer portal](https://jira.in.devexperts.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/122).

### Future Development

Features planned with **high priority**:

* add all market events
* add FEED Endpoint role
* provide tools and samples
* provide Swift packages
* generate documentation

---
Features planned for the **next stage**:

* Implement a model
  of [incremental updates](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-services/real-time-data-services/-net-api-incremental-updates.html)
  in Java API and add it to Swift API
* Implement OrderBookModel with advanced logic (e.g., OnNewBook, OnBookUpdate, OnBookIncrementalChange) in Java API and
  add it to Swift API
* Add samples or implement a convenient API
  for [Candlewebservice](https://kb.dxfeed.com/en/data-services/aggregated-data-services/candlewebservice.html)

### Implementation Details

We use [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/) technology and specially
written code that *wraps* Java methods into native ones
to get dynamically linked libraries for different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) based on
the [latest Java API package](https://dxfeed.jfrog.io/artifactory/maven-open/com/devexperts/qd/dxfeed-api/).

Then, the resulting dynamic link library (dxFeed Graal-native) is used through
C [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) (application binary interface),
and we write programming interfaces that describe our business model (similar to Java API).

As a result, we get a full-featured, similar performance as with Java API.
Regardless of the language, writing the final application logic using API calls will be very similar (only the syntax
will be amended, *"best practices"*, specific language restrictions)

Below is a scheme of this process:
